The Kanban system is a ***visual work management method that seeks to optimize workflow by limiting the amount of work in progress at each stage.*** 

This system uses a board with columns representing the stages of the process, such as "to do", "doing" and "done". Each task is represented by a card that moves around the board according to its status. 
   
The Kanban board follows ***four main rules***: start with what you have now, limit work in progress, manage flow and implement explicit policies. 

It also has ***six essential practices***: visualize the workflow, limit work in progress, manage the flow, make explicit policies, implement feedback loops and improve collaboratively. It is an agile method that seeks to avoid waste, increase productivity and quality, and promote continuous improvement.
